Other comments: 

I'm particular proud of:
- the floating button
- almost no common code

## Project grading 

Congratulations!
This is a very slick application in a modern design with good user interaction.
Interestingly, one cannot delete an entry?

You could have easily scored perfectly by providing the description.html,
include some comments, or write some tests. 

I award extra points for the artistic value and the particular effort that went into
the javascript code to make the detail page interactive.

Total grade: 5.6
